# Running Bayshore with Nix
There's a very hackily thrown-together flake present in this repository.

The flake does not initialise the database for you, so if you want to run this
from a cold install without a pre-existing database, lmao, good luck.

It also does not auto-generate a JSON config file for you, so you'll have to do it yourself.
